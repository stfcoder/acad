		<h2>Mandates</h2>

		<a name="m1"></a><h3>Mandate 1: Academy Courses</h3>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;">1. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL ACADEMY COURSES</p>

    <p>There are six examinable courses provided by the Academy: Counseling, Engineering, Gamemaster, Medical, Science and Security. The role of these courses is to improve the knowledge of role players in STF, and to qualify them for more specialised positions. For the purpose of classification, the 'Administration Menu Course' is now classed as an article.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">2. ACADEMY COURSE TUTORS</p>

    <p>Each course will be tutored by one individual who will be referred to as the Course Tutor. Any exam submissions, or questions about the course, should be sent to them. The Course Tutors are required to reply to any questions and mark any submissions within two weeks, unless on a declared Leave Of Absence. Course Tutors are also required to update the graduates list for their course, and to read the STF Question and Answer ship.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">3. COURSE CONTENT AND EXAMINATIONS</p>

    <p>All active members may take any examination. Members who pass a course will be put on the graduation lists. Members who do not pass may retry the examination at any time in the future, except in special circumstances including, but not limited to, plagiarism. These circumstances must be approved by the Academy Commandant.</p>

    <p>Course Tutors may change the content of the course, including the examination and its pass mark, with the consent of the Academy Commandant, and in the case of the Gamemaster course, with the consent of the Gamemaster Director as well. Due notice to the general public must be given.</p>

    <p>When a course is changed, the previous graduates of the course remain graduated, and therefore will remain on the graduates list for the course.</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;">4. LOCATION OF THE COURSES AND EXAMINATIONS</p>

    <p>The Academy Courses shall be kept in the STF Library. The Academy Commandant is required to ensure that the courses, and the contact details of the tutors, are kept up to date.</p>
